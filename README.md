# Portfolio

## My Process:

I began by creating the header and footer for every page to establish a base structure. Then, I added the main content using Bootstrap for layout and styling. I added my variable and root colours on CSS and made some changes that I was unable to do with bootstrap.

## Changes:

- **Removed the Behance Icon:** Originally intended to include it with a profile setup, but postponed as a summer project.
- **Contact Page Alignment:** Maintained left alignment for mobile view to preserve design consistency.
- **Reduced Projects:** Included only 4 projects instead of 6, as the other 2 are incomplete and not ready for publication.
- **Button Color Changes:** Updated button colors for a cleaner appearance.

The main challenge was deciding when to use Bootstrap versus CSS. I leaned towards using CSS for many aspects instead of exploring Bootstrap further.
