Portfolio

Changes:

1. I have removed the Behance Icon. I originally wanted to include it and have a profile setup, however, I haven't had the time and that will be a summer project.
2. On the contact page, I have left the mobile the align-left rather than be centered to maintain consistency in the design.
3. I only have 4 projects as opposed to 6. The other 2 are incomplete and not ready to be published yet.
